### Setup Instructions
   *Tip: This currently uses Python310. Edit setup and run batch files to change (I'll add a version check later.)
    Panels are draggable by clicking & holding panel title bar.
    This tool is still a WIP, so you may run into issues during use.
    This is not fully tested. Some items do not work. 
    Playing TD, DN, or Siege after fighting boss will bug out item & run counts at this moment; please play an adventure map in between.
    Run Time and the "Earned" labels are being worked on.
    This app runs on two threads.
    Untradable items currently add to market values -- communicating with dev to change.*

1. **Install Python:**  
   Ensure you have Python v3.10 installed on your machine. If not, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a different version, you will need to edit the Setup & Run script. This will be auto in the future.

2. **Initial Setup:**  
   Run the `Setup.bat` file to install any required modules.

3. **Settings:**  
   Make sure you have the "Settings>Options>Query API" turned on in game settings.

4. **Adding New Items:**  
   When providing new items, ensure that the file name exactly matches its name in the JSON data.
